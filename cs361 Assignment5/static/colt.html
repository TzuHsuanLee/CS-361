            <h3>Summary / Training Goals</h3>
            <p>Colt's basic obedience is excellent. He is able to focus on his owner in and out of the house. He is great at loose-leash walking but is currently working through some leash reactivity. Colt is not too food motivated. Colt does not show interest in chew toys but will interact with plush toys in play sessions.</p>
